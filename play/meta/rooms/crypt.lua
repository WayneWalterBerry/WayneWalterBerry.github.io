Their lids bear the carved likenesses of robed figures, hands folded over chests that will never rise again, faces worn smooth by time until they are almost featureless. Small niches are cut into the walls between the tombs, some holding candle stubs burned down to waxy puddles, others empty. The air is perfectly still, cold, and dry — the kind of stillness that comes from being sealed away from the world for centuries. Dust motes hang motionless in your light. Inscriptions cover every available surface — names, dates, prayers, and symbols that repeat like a chorus.",

A face, worn smooth, features eroded to suggestions. Between the coffins, small square holes in the wall — niches — containing waxy lumps and grit. The floor is bare rock, cold and gritty. The air is utterly still. No draft, no drip, no breath but your own. It smells of dust and old stone and the faint sweetness of ancient wax. You are in a tomb.",

Old wax — not fresh beeswax like the hallway, but candle wax burned years ago, its residue soaked into the stone niches. Dry stone — clean, cold, absent of moisture or life. No decay, no rot — whatever remains are in these coffins, they have long since returned to dust. The air smells of endings — not violent ones, but the quiet, patient ending of all things.",
