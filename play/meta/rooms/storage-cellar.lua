Dust covers everything — the flagstone floor, the collapsed crates, the remnants of rope and sacking scattered like shed skin. The air tastes of old wood, stale grain, and the sweet-sour tang of decay. Something scurries in the darkness beyond the reach of your light.",

You smell old grain, wood rot, and something sweetly rotten. From deeper in the room: a scratching sound, small and quick, like tiny claws on stone.",
