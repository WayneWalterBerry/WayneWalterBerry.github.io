The symbols upon its walls spoke of a duty: to guard what sleeps below, and to ensure it never wakes.\n\nI built this manor above the chamber, and my family has kept the vigil ever since. We are the Custodes -- the Keepers. Each generation inherits the burden. The altar is our covenant. The offering is our oath.\n\nIf you read these words, I am gone.
